# PyBer_Analysis

# Overview
Omar and myself are given an assignment to use Python and Pandas to create a summary Dataframe of the ride_sharing data by city type. Then, use the Pandas and Matplotlib to create a multipline graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type. Finally, procide a written summary of how the data differs by city type and how those differences can be decision makers at PyBer.

#Results

The results are as follows: 
    -- Urban areas lead in all categories of ride-sharing such as ride counts, driver counts, and total percentage fare amounts. 
    -- Suburban areas are the second with the second highest ride counts, driver counts, and total percentage fare amounts.
    -- Rural area have the least amount of ride counts, driver counts, and total percentage fare amounts.

#Business Recommendations

1. To increase riders in Suburban areas, I would recommend fpcusing marketing strategies toward this audience to reward repeat riders. For example, for ever 4 rides you use Pyber, you get a 5th ride free! This will encourage riders to ride more often resulting in an increase in income and increase in rides.
2. To show appreciation to our largest area of riders, Urban, I would recommend offering incentives to drivers. Increasing the number of drivers will increase the number of rides in the urban areas resulting in increase revenue. For example, you could offer a $50 gas card after every 100 trips completed. This will give drivers an attainable goal and drive positive revenue. 
3. To show appreciation to our Rural area riders, we could offer discounted rides during a certain timeframe of the day.
